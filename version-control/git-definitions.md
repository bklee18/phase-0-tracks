# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

1 What is version control?  Why is it useful?
- Version control is a system that allows concurrent edits to a programming code and allows a user to see each edit and merge to the master code as they see fit. 
- It's useful to allow multiple people to work on improving a master code at the same time while also reviewing each other's changes. 

2 What is a branch and why would you use one?
- A copy of code you want to work on and edit, and if it's satisfactory, you can merge it back to master code. A branch is a way to work on code withouth the risk of making it non-functional.

3 What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
- A commit is saving any changes you made in a branch to that branch. A good commit message is to be descriptive of the changes you made.

4 What is a merge conflict?
- A merge conflict occurs when the specific code you added/edited has already been added/edited in the destination file. Git doens't know which file to save, the existing one in destination or your new edits.
