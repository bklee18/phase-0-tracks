- Need to learn what is jquery, then what its relation is to html and web servers. Is it a scripting language? What is a scripting language? 
- Wikipedia would be a good starting point, then google more specific issues of jquery and what it is and what it can do.
- Ideally, test after each significant concept learned, but practically it would be better to test concepts that I have a hard time grasping or digesting, simpler concepts that can be comprehended from reading should not be tested.
- I think the first 30 min should be focused on finding out as much as I can about jquery, its uses and relation to other programming languages. 
- After that, find what jquery is capable of and test those concepts.
