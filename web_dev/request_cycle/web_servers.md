2. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
- The Linux design philosophies are based on having short, modular and singular task code where problems can be contained locally, solutions do not have verbose side effects and to have each tool accomplish a singular task cleanly and efficiently.

3. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
- A VPS is an instance of a virtual computer that can act as a server. This virtual computer acts as if it has all the physical hardware a PC does and can be used in a manner similar to that of a physical server. However, as this instance is sharing real, physical hardware with many other instances of VPS, the computing power can be severely limited compared to a physical server.
- The benefits of using a VPS are its low-cost compared to setting up/buying a real physical server, and its real-time nature that multiple users can collaborate with each other. 

4. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
- As the Linux system is designed to provide maximum flexiblity to a user, root users have access to any and all files and can alter them accordingly. In Linux, there are no safeguards to prevent an inexperienced user from ruining their own OS as compared to the safeguards in Windows and Apple.
- Another issue with using root is that all programs executed under the root user have root access. As programs can have errors and their own vulnerabilities, allowing these risks to be exposed while a root user can be disastrous.
