#Define a class named Puppy
# =>Add methods for this Puppy class such as bark method, wagging tail method and lick face method.
# =>Each of the above methods would output a PUTS line of the corresponding action.
#END of class methods

#Puppy.methods would return the available methods to call upon an instance of Puppy class
# =>duchess=Puppy.new
# =>fido=Puppy.new
# =>spot=Puppy.new
#The above code should produce 3 instances of the Puppy class stored in each of the variable names (duchess, fido, spot)
#I can now call my Puppy class methods onto each of those variables
# =>ex. duchess.bark should call my bark method onto the duchess variable.
